    <h2><strong>Nathan Pasley<strong><h2>
    <p>Hello. My name is Nathan Pasley and I am a senior GIS major at Texas State University. I also work full time for the U.S. Geological Survey as a student geographer. I've been able to apply many 
        of the skills there that I've learned at Texas State, like Python scripting, ArcGIS, Graphic design, remote sensing, and just some general geology I've picked up through my minor.</P>
